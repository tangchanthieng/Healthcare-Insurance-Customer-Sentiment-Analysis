## 1. Project Overview

In June 2021, nearly 14 million Australians or approximately 54.3% of the population, had some form of private health insurance which was an increase of around 1.4% since June 2020. This is the first annual increase in the proportion of Australians with health insurance since 2015. Australian consumers paid almost $25.7 billion in private health insurance premiums in 2020–21. Meanwhile the Australian government spent $37.6 billion on medical services and benefits (MBS), comprised largely of Medicare and Private Health Insurance rebate expenses in 2020-21. Unfortunately, there appears to be a division of opinion on the healthcare system in Australia. It has been postulated that these concerns have been shared widely on various social media platforms. The important of these concerns and the availability of data is a rare opportunity for data analytics specialists like yourself to apply AI and NLP techniques to generate actionable insights that can inform marketing strategy as well as public policy on the topic of Health Insurance. 

## 2. Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to analyze social media conversations to understand public sentiment and key concerns regarding the Australian healthcare system, including both public (Medicare) and private health insurance (Medibank, Bupa, HBF). The insights generated will be used to inform marketing strategies for private health insurance firms and provide actionable recommendations for public policy enhancement.

## 3. Requirements

- Agile Planning: Project management and detailed planning of Agile works. Sprints and timeline are carefully setup for team members. Feedbacks and contributions are frequently updated. 
- Data Collection and Pre-processing: Crawl and clean social media (X) data to prepare it for analysis. This includes removing null values, unnecessary columns, duplicates, and noise from the text data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Determine the overall public sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) towards the Australian healthcare system and specific insurance providers.
- Topic Modeling: Identify the main topics and themes of discussion within the social media conversations.
- Temporal Analysis: Analyze how sentiment and topics of discussion have evolved over time.
- Actionable Insights: Generate actionable insights and recommendations for marketing strategies and public policy based on the analysis.
