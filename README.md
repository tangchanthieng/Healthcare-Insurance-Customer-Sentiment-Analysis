# Healthcare-Insurance-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis

## 1. Project Overview  
In June 2021, nearly 14 million Australians or approximately 54.3% of the population, had some form of private health insurance which was an increase of around 1.4% since June 2020. This is the first annual increase in the proportion of Australians with health insurance since 2015. Australian consumers paid almost $25.7 billion in private health insurance premiums in 2020â€“21. Meanwhile the Australian government spent $37.6 billion on medical services and benefits (MBS), comprised largely of Medicare and Private Health Insurance rebate expenses in 2020-21. Unfortunately, there appears to be a division of opinion on the healthcare system in Australia. It has been postulated that these concerns have been shared widely on various social media platforms. The important of these concerns and the availability of data is a rare opportunity for data analytics specialists like yourself to apply AI and NLP techniques to generate actionable insights that can inform marketing strategy as well as public policy on the topic of Health Insurance. 

## 3. Process Overview

### 3.1 Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze social media conversations to understand public sentiment and key concerns regarding the Australian healthcare system, including both public (Medicare) and private health insurance (Medibank, Bupa, HBF). ðŸ©º The insights generated will be used to inform marketing strategies for private health insurance firms and provide actionable recommendations for public policy enhancement.

### 3.2 Scope
The scope of this project encompasses the application of AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a dataset of social media posts (tweets) related to Australian healthcare insurance firms (Medibank, Medicare, Bupa, and HBF). The analysis will focus on sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and temporal analysis to identify trends and key themes in public discourse.

### 3.3 Business Requirements
- Data Collection and Pre-processing: Collect and clean social media data to prepare it for analysis. This includes removing null values, unnecessary columns, duplicates, and noise from the text data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Determine the overall public sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) towards the Australian healthcare system and specific insurance providers.
- Topic Modeling: Identify the main topics and themes of discussion within the social media conversations.
- Temporal Analysis: Analyze how sentiment and topics of discussion have evolved over time.
- Actionable Insights: Generate actionable insights and recommendations for marketing strategies and public policy based on the analysis.

### 3.4 Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of NLP sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques on the provided dataset.
- Identification of key themes and sentiment drivers in public conversations about the Australian healthcare system.
- Generation of a comprehensive report with actionable insights and recommendations for healthcare insurance firms and public policy makers.
- The project will be considered successful if it can provide a clear understanding of public opinion, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
